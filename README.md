# judo-evaluation-system

judo-evaluation-system is a wonderful new way of handling a judo tournament.
Instead of doing everything on paper and then have trouble agregating the different results, we have automated everything with this cool app!

## Features

  -  register teams and athletes
  -  organize your teams in pools
  -  visualize instantly the results of matches between different teams
  -  pretty and intuitive match interface

## Installation

### For Ubuntu 18.04:
First, install docker, docker-compose and npm.
Then run the following command in the root folder of the projet:
`cd front-judo && npm install`

To launch it, you can run this command:
`docker-compose up -d app && cd front-judo && npm start`

### For everything else:
Good luck !

## Future updates

  -  use brackets as a new tournament system !
  -  put the front in a docker image for easier launch
